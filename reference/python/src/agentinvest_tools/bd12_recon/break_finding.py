"""The E-24-shaped break finding + the deterministic of-record cause-classifier (OIM-162 cycle-1).

The shared contract the four SD-12.10 reconcile tools emit: a typed, E-24-shaped **break finding**
(the in-flight value, before it is persisted as an immutable E-24 break event) plus the
**deterministic, of-record cause-classifier** — rules over neutral observable evidence that assign
``cause_classification`` (E-24's vocabulary), leaving any break the rules cannot reach
``unexplained``.

THE DETERMINISTIC SPINE (the load-bearing design point). The cause-classification is the **of-record
classification** — a pure function of observable evidence, NO LLM (the propose-only LLM over the
``unexplained`` residue is OIM-162 cycle-2, not this cycle). A break the rules cannot reach is
``unexplained`` — the of-record value — never force-fit and never guessed (Kleppmann/Helland: derive
the classification as a view over the feed; the deterministic spine keeps the LLM out of the
knowledge-claim path). The rules are exhaustively unit-testable precisely because they are
deterministic.

THE CLASSIFIER DOES NOT READ THE ANSWER KEY. The custodian feed carries a ``break_note`` column
(``fx_break`` / ``price_break`` / ...), but that is the OIM-160 injected label — using it would be
reading the oracle, not classifying. The classifier therefore derives the cause from NEUTRAL
observable evidence only:

- ``timing``           — the quantity difference is exactly explained by a known in-flight E-05
trade
                         (TD-booked internally, not yet SD-settled by the custodian — read via the
                         OIM-161 pending-activity tool). A TD/SD timing divergence, not a hard
                         break.
- ``data_error``       — a quantity difference NOT explained by any in-flight trade (a genuine share
                         miscount), or a cash balance disagreement.
- ``fx``               — quantity agrees, market value differs beyond the bp band, the value-ratio
                         (external / internal) is < 1 (the custodian translates the value LOWER) AND
                         that ratio is SHARED across two or more holdings — the SYSTEMATIC downward
                         translation factor (the same FX rate applied to several USD-translated
                         holdings), the of-record signature of an FX-rate difference.
- ``pricing``          — quantity agrees, market value differs beyond the bp band, AND the custodian
                         value is ABOVE the internal book (ratio > 1) — an idiosyncratic mark
                         difference (the custodian marks higher), never the downward fx-translation
                         signature.
- ``missing_transaction`` — a transaction present on one side of the match only.
- ``fees``             — a fee/charge difference (no fee-class break is injected; the rule is for
                         completeness, firing on a genuine fee-line divergence only). No oracle
                         label
                         carries ``fees`` in the OIM-197 enriched feed — it is a valid, currently
                         instance-free cause.
- ``unexplained``      — no rule fires. The of-record residue (the propose-only LLM input). This now
                         ALSO covers a LONE downward value difference (a single holding, ratio < 1,
                         unique): no cluster signal and no direction signal separates a
                         single-holding
                         fx from a single-holding pricing-below, so the narrowed rule STOPS GUESSING
                         (the OIM-162 cycle-2 honest demotion — cycle-1 wrongly called it
                         ``pricing``).

THE NARROWING (OIM-162 cycle-2 rule-discovery — the flywheel promote + demote). Cycle-1's fx/pricing
rule was a single ratio-cluster signal, proven over-broad in three adversarial modes by the cycle-1
functional audit. Cycle-2 NARROWS it with the DIRECTION of the value difference (a label-independent
observable): a value the custodian marks ABOVE the book is ``pricing`` (flips the coincidental
shared-ratio pricing pair back to correct); a LONE downward value difference is ``unexplained`` (the
honest demotion of the single-holding misread). A pricing break whose downward ratio coincides
EXACTLY with a genuine fx cluster's ratio stays misclassified ``fx`` — observably indistinguishable
in this USD-only feed, carried + documented, never force-fit. See ``classify_value_diffs``.

The ``fx`` vs ``pricing`` split needs the WHOLE position-break population (the ratio-cluster is a
property of the set, not one row), so the position reconcile classifies AFTER it has gathered every
qty-agree value difference — the classifier takes the candidate set and resolves the split in one
pass.

    THE NARROWED OF-RECORD FX/PRICING RULE (OIM-162 cycle-2 rule-discovery — the flywheel promote).
    Cycle-1 used a single ratio-cluster signal (``ratio shared by ≥2 → fx; unique → pricing``). The
    cycle-1 functional audit proved that rule OVER-BROAD in three adversarial modes (a
    single-holding
    fx misread as pricing; a coincidental shared-ratio pricing pair misread as fx; a pricing ratio
    that collides with an fx ratio misread as fx). Cycle-2 NARROWS the rule with ONE additional
    label-independent observable — the **direction** of the value difference — and demotes the cases
    no observable signal can reach to ``unexplained`` rather than guessing:

    - **direction > 1 (custodian value ABOVE the internal book) → ``pricing``.** A USD-value
      FX-translation difference moves a reported value when the custodian and the book disagree on
      the translation rate; in this feed the systematic translation signature is a SHARED DOWNWARD
      ratio (every genuine fx break translates the custodian value LOWER, ratio < 1). A value the
      custodian marks ABOVE the book is an idiosyncratic mark difference, never the downward
      translation signature → ``pricing``. (This is the discovered rule that flips the coincidental
      shared-ratio pricing pair from the cycle-1 fx misread back to ``pricing``.)
    - **direction < 1 AND the ratio is shared by ≥2 candidates → ``fx``.** The systematic downward
      translation factor — the genuine fx signature (a shared rate applied to several
      USD-translated holdings).
    - **direction < 1 AND the ratio is UNIQUE (a single holding) → ``unexplained``.** A lone
    downward
      value difference carries NO cluster signal AND NO direction signal that separates a single-
      holding fx from a single-holding pricing-below: the of-record rule STOPS GUESSING and lands
      ``unexplained`` (the honest demotion — the cycle-1 rule wrongly called this ``pricing`` with
      false confidence). The propose-only LLM (the residue) annotates it; no deterministic
      observable-evidence rule in this feed can honestly resolve it.
    - **direction == 1 (a zero-amount value difference) → falls through to the cluster rule**
      (``unique → pricing``; the POS-0019 by-construction A/B-disagreement pin, unperturbed).

    THE HONEST BOUNDARY (the residue this rule does NOT reach). A pricing break whose downward ratio
    COINCIDES EXACTLY with a genuine fx cluster's ratio is observably indistinguishable from a
    member of that cluster — it clusters as ``fx`` and stays misclassified. No label-independent
    rule in this USD-only synthetic feed can separate them (the only discriminator is the
    ``break_note``
    answer key, which the engine must never read). This residual misclassification is carried,
    documented, NOT force-fit (OIM-162 cycle-2 report).

    Derived PURELY from the observable values (the external/internal ratio + its direction + the
    cluster membership) — NEVER from the custodian's ``break_note`` label. Proven label-independent
