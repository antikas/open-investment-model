"""``load_tool_catalogue`` — the tool-RAG seam over the candidate tool surface.

The catalogue is the set of candidate ``ToolDescriptor``s the planner selects
among for a task. Two sources:

- **the orchestrator path** — the live ``bd09.list_capabilities`` catalogue (the
  5 SO-09 tool schemas), loaded over the Restate ingress;
- **the eval path** — the eval set's candidate descriptors (the SAME candidate
  sets the OIM-105/106 deterministic baseline scored over), built from an
  ``EvalSet``'s ``tools``.

**Honest boundary — this is a SEAM, not real retrieval (ADR-0054).** At ~5 BD-09
tools (or ~16 in the cross-office eval set), there is nothing to retrieve: the
catalogue is small enough to pass whole. ``load_tool_catalogue`` therefore
*loads all candidate tools* — a documented v0.1 behaviour, NOT a sophisticated
RAG doing dynamic scoping. The **seam exists** so that when OIM-120+ grows the
surface to ~900 tools, a real per-task retriever (embedding / RAG over the
catalogue) plugs in HERE without changing the planner or the orchestrator. We do
NOT pretend a large-catalogue retriever is load-bearing yet — it is not. The
function's contract (task + source -> candidate descriptors) is the seam; its
v0.1 body is load-all.
